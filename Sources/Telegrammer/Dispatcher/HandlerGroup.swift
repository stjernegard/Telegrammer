 Class of custom handlers group.

 `id` represent also priority of group, lower = higher priority.
 Property `name` of group is used to determine when two group are equals. When you will try to remove
 handler from `Dispatcher`, you will need to point, from which group to delete it by mention group `name`.
 Also we offer predefined group called `zero`, which has highest priority and used in `Dispatcher` by default.
